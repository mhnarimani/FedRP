# FedRP: A Communication-Efficient Approach for Differentially Private Federated Learning Using Random Projection

This repository contains the implementation of **FedRP**, a novel federated learning algorithm that enhances communication efficiency and privacy by combining **Random Projection** with the **ADMM optimization framework**.

FedRP is designed for federated learning settings and provides a strong (Ïµ, Î´)-Differential Privacy guarantee without sacrificing model accuracy.

## ðŸ§  Method Overview

FedRP introduces a secure dimension-reduction step (via random projection) on the client side before model updates are sent to the server. This significantly reduces communication costs and enhances privacy by preventing reconstruction attacks.

- Clients use a **shared random projection matrix** to project model parameters.
- Optimization is performed using **Consensus ADMM** in the projected space.
- FedRP avoids the need to reverse the projections, unlike FedSketch and similar methods.
